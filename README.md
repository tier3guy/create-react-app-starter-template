# React App Template - Avinash ✨

Welcome to the React App Template - Avinash! This template is designed to provide you with a highly configurable React application setup, complete with a Prettier extension, default routing, and authentication. You can also easily extend the template by adding additional tech stacks like Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, or Firebase. 🚀

## Features 🎉

- Highly Configurable: The React App Template - Avinash allows you to customize your React application according to your needs. 🛠️
- Prettier Extension: The template comes pre-configured with the Prettier extension, ensuring consistent code formatting. ✨
- Default Routing: Basic routing is already set up in the template, allowing you to create multiple pages or views easily. 🌍

## Usage 🚀

To quickly create a new React app using the Avinash template, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name
```

Replace `./folder-name` with the desired name for your project's folder. This command will set up a basic React app using the Avinash template.

If you want to add Tailwind CSS to your project, simply append `tailwind` at the end of the command:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name tailwind
```

For TypeScript integration, append `typescript`:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name typescript
```

To include both Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, use:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name typescript-tailwind
```

For Firebase integration, append `firebase`:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name firebase
```

You can also combine Firebase with other options. For example:

```shell
npx create-react-avinash-app ./folder-name typescript-firebase
```
